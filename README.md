# Dispatch jQuery UI Redesign

This repository contains CSS themes and assets for a jQuery UI redesign used by the Dispatch project. It includes multiple jQuery UI themes and supporting images.

Structure:
- `css/` — theme stylesheets, images, and custom CSS used by the application.

Quick start:
1. Serve the project files from a web server (static file hosting).
2. Include the appropriate CSS files in your HTML pages.

If you want me to, I can add contribution notes, license, or a more detailed developer guide.
